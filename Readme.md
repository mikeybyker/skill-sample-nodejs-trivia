# Rewrite of the Alexa Trivia Skill Example App

An es6 update of the [Alexa trivia skill example app](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia).

Started as a quick bug fix of the original, ended up a rewrite/update to make it a little easier to work with.
Uses es6 features - requires the Node 6.1 runtime in your AWS Lamba configuration.

The way it works is the same (...might be an argument to change that too...) - so it can drop in replace an existing skill using the same questions/answer format.

[Take a look at the original](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia) if you are not familiar with it - there's a step by step guide should you need it.
